# Repertoire Manager

Repertoire Manager is a web application that allows musicians (particularly collaborative pianists) to catalog and retrieve information on pieces of music they have played.

## Usage

Interacting with Repertoire Manager, users can:
* Add a new piece of music to their repertoire and store it on a local database
* Delete a piece of music from their local repertoire database
* Filter and display pieces from their repertoire:
 - By composer name
 - By instrument
* Display all pieces of music in their repertoire

## Roadmap for Future Plans
Currently, Repertoire Manger is built to store repertoire data on a local host server. A potential improvement for the future would be for the data to be stored on a remote server. Other possibilities includes allowing for account sign-ups, providing the ability for different musicians to store distinct repertoire lists and access them on the web from any location.
